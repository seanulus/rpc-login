# Getting Started with the RPC Login

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Initializing the Project

1. Make sure you have `npm` and `node` installed with a version of Node 14 or higher.
2. Use the `Code` dropdown or copy this link https://github.com/seanulus/rpc-login.git to clone the repo using the `git clone` command in your terminal.
3. Verify that all modules are installed by running `npm install` after the repo is successfully cloned.

Continue with the below steps once the above are complete.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

I didn't have enough time to write up any tests for this app so all available test/s were included in the initial setup.
